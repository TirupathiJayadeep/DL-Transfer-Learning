# DL- Developing a Neural Network Classification Model using Transfer Learning

## AIM
To develop an image classification model using transfer learning with VGG19 architecture for the given dataset.

## THEORY


## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1: 

Load and normalize data, create sequences.


### STEP 2: 

Convert data to tensors and set up DataLoader.


### STEP 3: 
Define the RNN model architecture.



### STEP 4: 

Summarize, compile with loss and optimizer.


### STEP 5: 
Train the model with loss tracking.


### STEP 6: 

Predict on test data, plot actual vs. predicted prices.
